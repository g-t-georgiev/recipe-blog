# Recipes Blog

## Overview

Recipes blog is an application for recipe searching, reading and posting. It is divided into private and public parts, depending on the user status (authenticated or unauthenticated), as well as the role of the user (guest, user, author).

Guests (or unauthenticated users) have access to the home, login, register, recipes and details pages. They could search and browse the available recipes users have posted, but cannot "like" (add to favorites), write reviews and/or rate any of them.

Registered and signed in (authenticated) users can pretty much access all public pages, except for login and register. They have the opportunity to create new recipes/articles, as well as write reviews, rate and add to favorites the work of others (but not their own).
